## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  - üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
  - ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  - üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
  - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  - ‚¨áÔ∏è `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript code is linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

- Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
- Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible

  ```javascript
  // Use this:
  export default class ClassName {

  }

  // Instead of:
  class ClassName {

  }
  export default ClassName
  ```

- Place requires in the following order:
  - Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
  - Built in Salesforce modules (such as `@salesforce/apex`)
  - Local Modules (using relative paths)

### Apex Styleguide

- Follow the [Apex Code Conventions](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_classes_code_conv.htm)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add proper documentation for all public methods
- Write test methods for all code paths (minimum 90% coverage)
- Use `@TestVisible` annotation for private methods that need testing

### LWC Styleguide

- Follow the [LWC Best Practices](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.best_practices)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use `@api` decorators for public properties
- Document all public properties and methods
- Write Jest tests for all components
